This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Hack code involving recursive factorial calculations.  Two functions, `foo` and `bar`, appear functionally identical, but one produces incorrect results. The solution highlights the underlying issue and provides a corrected version. This is a useful example showcasing the importance of careful attention to detail in recursive function design in Hack.
